      question: "What is CRIA and what makes it unique in the LLM world?",
      answer: 'Standing on the shoulders of giants, CRIA is a Large Language Model (LLM) that is instruction tuned on <a href="https://ai.meta.com/llama/" style="text-decoration: underline;">Meta Llama 2</a> (7B, Chat) Model—a top-tier open-source LLM as of writing. The base model powers CRIA to offer engaging interactions and impressive contextual understanding.<br><br> CRIA is further fine-tuned on a <i>free colab instance</i> using the <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/mlabonne/CodeLlama-2-20k" style="text-decoration: underline;">CodeLlama-2-20k</a> instruction dataset, enhancing its coding capabilities. Additionally, the inference model is quantized, optimizing it for swift deployment and rapid inference. This means you get efficiency without compromising on quality.<br><br> In essence, CRIA is a proof-of-concept, showcasing the potential of instruction tuning even with <i>free, limited resources</i>. Beyond that, it remains well-versed in a broad spectrum of topics, making it an interesting conversation partner. Try CRIA now!',

      question: "What does CRIA stands for?",
      answer: "A cria, pronounced as krē-ə, embodies the spirit of a baby llama. It is a homage to its base model, Meta Llama 2.",

      question: "Why does CRIA frequently mention taking naps??",
      answer: 'Hosting a LLM on cloud servers comes with a considerable cost, especially for a project pursued out of interest. Consequently, the inference process is often turned off to manage the costs.<br><br> If you\'re interest to see a live demonstration, don\'t hesitate to <a href="mailto:walter.tengkw@gmail.com" style="text-decoration: underline;">get in touch with me</a>. Moreover, if you have any methods for near-zero cost hosting or even cost-effective alternatives, please don\'t hesitate to <a href="mailto:walter.tengkw@gmail.com" style="text-decoration: underline;">reach out</a>. Your input and ideas are invaluable to me, and I\'m keen to engage in discussions with fellow enthusiasts like you.',

        question: "What are the intended use cases for CRIA? Can I rely on the accuracy of CRIA's responses.",
        answer: 'The primary purpose of CRIA is to showcase the potential of fine tuning your own LLM with freely available resources. It is crucial to recognize that this process is highly experimental. <br><br>Please exercise caution and avoid interpreting CRIA\'s responses as authoritative advice. A thorough model evaluation is part of the roadmap to enhance the understanding and capabilities of CRIA.',
